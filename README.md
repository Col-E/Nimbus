# Nimbus

A highly configurable networking framework for publish-subscribe systems.

## Setup

This project currently targets Java 8, but requires a Java 11 dependency.
To allow this, please use [Maven-Class-Patcher](https://github.com/Col-E/Maven-Class-Patcher) to build the project.

At some point I may opt to drop Java 8 support so this is not a requirement.
